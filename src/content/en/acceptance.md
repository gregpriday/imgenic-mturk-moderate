## Acceptance Criteria for Image Ratings

Each image will be reviewed and rated by multiple people to determine its average rating. The goal is to identify high-quality images, which will feature prominently in our selection, based on these average ratings.

Your ratings are important and should generally align with the overall consensus. We understand that ratings are subjective and may vary slightly between different raters. This is expected and acceptable. However, ratings that consistently and significantly deviate from the average may indicate a lack of careful consideration or even the use of automated rating systems.

To protect the integrity of our system, we can only accept ratings that correlate reasonably well with the average. If a rater's scores are often significantly different from the average, their ratings may not be accepted, and they could be prevented from rating images in the future.

Please note, this is not about penalizing individual perspectives. It's about ensuring each rating is given due consideration, and the rating process is not being abused or automated. As long as you are evaluating each image carefully and providing honest ratings, your contribution will be valued and accepted.

Thank you for your commitment to maintaining the quality of our image selection process.
