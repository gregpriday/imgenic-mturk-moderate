## Acceptance Criteria for Image Selection

Each image you review will be evaluated by multiple people to derive the most popular choices. The objective is to spotlight high-quality images, which will be decided based on collective preferences.

Your selections are crucial and should generally align with the broader consensus. We understand that preferences are subjective and might slightly differ between different selectors, which is expected and acceptable. However, if your choices consistently and significantly deviate from the majority's, it may suggest a lack of careful consideration or misuse of the system.

To uphold the integrity of our system, we can only accept selections that reasonably match the group's preferences. If a selector's choices often differ significantly from the majority, their selections may not be acknowledged, and they may be barred from future image selection tasks.

Please note that this isn't about punishing unique perspectives. It's about ensuring each image is given thorough consideration, and the selection process isn't being misused or automated. As long as you're scrutinizing each image carefully and making honest selections, your contribution will be appreciated and acknowledged.

Thank you for your dedication to maintaining the quality of our image selection process.
