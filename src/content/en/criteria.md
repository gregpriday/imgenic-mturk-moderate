## Image Rating Criteria

In this task, your role is to evaluate AI-generated images and assign them a star rating, ranging from 0 (Remove/Full Rejection) to 5 (Exceptional Quality), based on the criteria provided in this document. Interpreting the quality of an image can be subjective, but these guidelines aim to provide a consistent framework for your evaluations.

Remember, this task isn't only about spotting faultsâ€”it's also about identifying high-quality, realistic images. Your contributions play a vital role in ensuring that only the most convincing and visually appealing AI-generated images are approved. We extend our gratitude for your attention to detail and your dedication to maintaining high standards in this task. Thank you for your participation!

### Remove (0 Star) - Full Rejection
Images with severe distortions, lack of symmetry, or other unnatural elements that make them obviously AI generated. Most importantly, any image with a visible watermark or signature is automatically rejected as this is a clear indicator of AI generation. This includes:
- Two heads, extra limbs or digits, or missing body parts (especially noticeable on humans or animals)
- Unnatural proportions on bodies, furniture, or objects
- Text that is unreadable or obviously distorted
- Merged crowds, or bodies blending with objects or backgrounds
- Backgrounds looking like textures rather than actual environments
- Blatant signatures or watermarks imitating commercial art
- Large scenes that look incorrect or distorted

### 1 Star - Poor
Images that have some believable elements, but are still clearly AI-generated due to less severe but still noticeable issues. This could include:
- Issues with hands or other body parts that aren't as severe as 0-star images but still noticeable
- Animals or objects with incorrect proportions or missing elements
- Slightly unnatural accessories/clothing or furniture (like glasses or tables missing legs)
- Background elements looking slightly strange
- Books with edges on more than one side
- Slight asymmetry in vehicles or complex objects

### 2 Star - Below Average
Images where the AI-generated artifacts are not immediately obvious, but become noticeable upon closer inspection. These images might have:
- Unnaturally interacting elements, like human hands holding items in a weird way
- Certain elements, especially intricate ones like chains or detailed items like watches, that look strange
- Images with an overall unnatural feel that you can't quite put your finger on
- Furniture or other objects missing less noticeable elements, like table legs

### 3 Star - Average
Images where the AI-generated issues are quite subtle and only noticeable upon very careful inspection. Characteristics might include:
- Slight asymmetry in faces or objects that are not immediately noticeable
- Subtle issues with proportions or details, like iguanas having slightly incorrect number of fingers
- Very small sections of the image looking painted or blurred
- Background elements that are slightly off but not enough to detract from the overall image
- Subtle unnatural look to accessories or clothing

### 4 Star - High Quality
Images that are mostly indistinguishable from a real photograph. They may contain minor imperfections, but overall, they would pass for a quality photo to the untrained eye. These images would include:
- Minor issues that are only noticeable upon very close inspection, such as slight distortions in intricate details or text.
- A cohesive, believable scene that does not immediately suggest AI generation.
- Overall impressive composition and quality, similar to what might be found in a general-interest magazine.

### 5 Star - Exceptional Quality
These images would be indistinguishable from high-quality photographs or works of art created by professionals. This includes:
- Absolutely no noticeable distortions, asymmetry, or unnatural elements.
- Text is perfectly normal and readable.
- Backgrounds and environments are not just coherent, but also contribute to a well-composed scene.
- Intricate details, including things like chains or hands, are well-rendered and look natural.
- The image is not just believable, but impressive - comparable to something you might see in a high-end magazine or gallery. It should give no reason whatsoever to suspect it's AI-generated.
