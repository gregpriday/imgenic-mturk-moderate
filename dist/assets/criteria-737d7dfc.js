const e=`## Image Selection Guide

Hello and welcome to your task! Your mission is to sift through a set of 24 AI-generated images and pick the top four. You are our quality control expert, on a mission to find the most convincing and visually appealing images.

Before we delve into the task, let's take a moment to discuss the qualities you should be searching for:

### Consider Selecting an Image If:
- **It's Realistic**: If the image convincingly mimics a photo or piece of artwork, that's a strong sign it's a keeper. We're not interested in images that obviously seem computer-generated.
- **The Details are Spot-on**: Don't overlook the small stuff. Text should be legible, objects should look natural, and everything should be in its proper place.
- **It's Cohesive**: A top-quality image forms a cohesive scene where every element harmoniously contributes to the overall image. The backdrop, the objects, the ambience - everything should blend together well.
- **It's Striking**: We're after images that could grace the pages of a high-quality magazine or hang on the wall of an art gallery.

### Avoid Selecting an Image If:
- **It's Unrealistic**: Skip images that include bizarre features such as extra limbs, multiple heads, or anything else that breaks the illusion of reality.
- **Text is Illegible, or There Are Watermarks**: Any image with unreadable or strange text, or any visible watermarks, should be passed over.
- **Human Proportions Are Wrong**: A common issue is strange hands, on humans holding objects in an incorrect way.
- **The Proportions or Interactions are Incorrect**: If animals or objects seem to be the wrong size, or if they interact with one another in an unnatural way, you'll want to dismiss that image.
- **The Background Isn't Appropriate**: If the backdrop looks more like a texture than an environment, that image isn't right for our needs.

As you get more experienced with the task, you'll find you can speed up your ratings by quickly assessing images based on their thumbnails. With practice, you'll be able to look at a thumbnail and immediately determine whether it has a shot at being in the top four. You'll soon recognize which type of images rarely make the cut.

However, don't let speed compromise the quality of your selections. While you can rapidly reject an image, you should scrutinize potential candidates thoroughly before adding them to your final selection. Make sure you take a detailed look and zoom in on any suspicious parts of the image.

Please remember, among the set, we've included a "gold standard" image, a real image chosen by our expert panel. Your ability to spot and select this image will play a key role in assessing your image selection proficiency.

Thanks in advance for your dedication to this task. Your careful selections help ensure we only showcase the most convincing and attractive AI-generated images. Happy selecting!`;export{e as default};
