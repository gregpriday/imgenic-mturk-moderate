Hello, and welcome to our tutorial on how to use our image selection system. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of selecting the top images from our user-friendly interface.

### Step 1: Previewing Images

Our system displays a grid of images for you to review. You can click on any image to view a larger version of it. This should help you get a better look and feel of each image.

### Step 2: Zooming In on Images

Want to see finer details? No problem. Just move your mouse over the larger image, and it will zoom in to let you see up close. This way, you can carefully check all the details and make a more informed decision.

### Step 3: Selecting Images

If you think an image is one of the top four, click on it again in the grid to select it. It will highlight with green and a white check mark. Remember, you can only select up to four images from the batch.

### Step 4: Deselecting Images

Changed your mind? Don't worry, just click the selected image again to deselect it.

### Step 5: Viewing Your Selection

At any point, you can check how many images you've selected so far in the top bar. This will help you manage your picks and make sure you don't go over the limit of four images.

### Step 6: Submitting Your Selection

Once you're happy with your selection of four images, press the "Submit Selection" button to finalize your choices.

And there you have it! Our straightforward image selection system enables you to handpick the best images with ease. Each choice you make is invaluable in helping us refine our AI-generated images. Thank you for your effort, and happy selecting!`;export{e as default};
